# Demonstration of variable arrays bug in BilevelJuMP with MibS solver. 

# Model of the problem
# First level
# ```math
# \max_{{\bf x}} \sum_{i,j} x_{i,j},\\
# \notag s.t.\\
# x \in \{0, 1\}^{n \times ^n},\\

# Second level
# ```math
# \max_{{\bf y}} \sum_{i,j} y_{i,j},\\
# \notag s.t.\\
# \sum_{j \in [n]} y_{j,j} == 1,\\
# y \in \{0, 1\}^{n \times ^n}.\\

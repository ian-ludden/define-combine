Bizarrely, the solution when requiring y2_2 + y5_5 >= 2 assigns 
y16_5 = 1 and y9_16 = 1. (see bottom)

And even when I only have the 16 variables of the form y[i]_[i], 
with y2_2 + y5_5 >= 2, it assigns 
y11_11 = 1 and y5_5 = 1. (see just below)

=== With 16 y variables: ===
*** Combiner assignment ***
Dict(4 => 1.0, 10 => 1.0)

y11_11 is a nonzero lower var: 1.00
y5_5 is a nonzero lower var: 1.00
